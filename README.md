Modern IE App for Ghost
=============

This is a Ghost App (Plugin) which enables support for the Modern.ie parser in local projects. It can be used to check your Ghost blog passes the modern.ie tests even if you are testing locally or perhaps behind a firewall.

Currently Ghost App API has not been defined but discussion and experimentation continues here. https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/769


The project is influenced by https://github.com/jgable/ghost-plugin
